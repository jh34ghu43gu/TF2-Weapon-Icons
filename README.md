# TF2 Weapon Icons
Annoyingly there does not appear to be a place to get a nice zip directory of tf2 weapon icons so here you go.
Prepared by https://steamcommunity.com/id/jh34ghu43gu/

All images belong to Valve Software

All images are 512x512 taken from the tf2 wiki and start with "Backpack_" followed by the item name with '_' instead of spaces.

Weapons directory contains every weapon broken into classes and then slots. 
In order to avoid duplicate files all multi-class weapons, even if only used by 2 classes, are put in the multi-class folder. The (mostly) all class melees are in the melee folder and the rest are just sitting in the folder, organize however you wish.
Botkillers or skins are not included however australiums are.
^Golden frying pan can be located in that folder instead of multi-class.

Action directory contains all infinitely reusable action items (besides the winter noisemaker).

Taunts directory contains all the taunt icons also sorted by class.
